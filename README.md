# poultry-cattle-manure
The dataset consists of 332 manure samples from poultry and cattle origin, sampled in farms located in major 
regions of livestock production in mainland France and Reunion Island. The samples were analysed for seven 
chemical properties following conventional laboratory methods : dry matter (DM), total ammonium nitrogen (NH4), 
total nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P2O5), calcium (CaO), magnesium (MgO) and potassium (K2O). Near-Infrared (NIR) 
spectra were acquired with three spectrometers on fresh homogenized and dried ground samples and standardized 
by PDS algorithm. (2020-08-31)
